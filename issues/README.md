## Urgent Issues

Urgent issues are those that prevent you from working on class material. Examples include an error on assignment starter code or a broken link for a walkthrough video. Please email `coding101@devetry.com` if you find a problem like this, and we'll try to take care of it.

## Non-urgent Issues and Enhancements

Typos or similar "non-blocking" issues should be reported as [issues on the GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/Devetry/web-fundamentals/issues).

We also appreciate suggestions for enhancements to the course site or course material via GitHub issues.
