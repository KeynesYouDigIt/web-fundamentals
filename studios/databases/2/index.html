                    <h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h2>
<p>In this studio we'll be working in MAMP using the tool <em>phpMyAdmin</em>. We'll create a new user account and associated database for our movie-buff project. Then we'll import a <code>.sql</code> file and get the tables we'll use from that. Then we'll perform some queries on that data.</p>
<h3 id="database-setup">Database Setup</h3>
<p>Let's start by setting up a new database for this project with a new, associated user account.</p>
<p>Start up MAMP. From the launcher window, select <em>Start Servers</em>. Once that button has turned green, choose <em>Open Start Page</em>. From the page that opens up in your browser, select <em>Tools &gt; phpMyAdmin</em>.</p>
<p>Select <em>Users</em> (on a Mac it will be called <em>User accounts</em>).</p>
<p><img src="images/mamp-user.png" alt="Users" /></p>
<p>Fill out the resulting form with info for your application. A good pattern to follow is that you should have a different user for each application, and the username should match the name of your application.</p>
<p>Set the <em>Host name</em> field to <em>Local</em> and set a password. For local development, it's acceptable to use a simple password. Just be sure that you don't use the same password on a production database if you deploy your application!</p>
<p>And be sure to check the first checkbox under <em>Database for user account</em>. If you don't do this, you'll have to create a database and set permissions manually. The image below shows what your settings for this user should look like.</p>
<p><img src="images/mamp-user-add.png" alt="Add user" /></p>
<p>Finally, press the small <em>Go</em> button at the bottom.</p>
<h3 id="import-tables-from">Import Tables From <code>.sql</code></h3>
<p>You should see the database name <code>movie-buff</code> on the left side. Double click on it to go into that database.</p>
<p>Now, download this SQL file: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7qc2gnpdtz9uivq/movie-buff.sql?dl=1">movie-buff.sql</a>.</p>
<p>Then click the <em>Import</em> tab. Browse your computer to find the <code>movie-buff.sql</code> file you downloaded (on a Mac it may be <code>movie-buff.sql.txt</code>). Leave all the default selections as they are (the blue boxes with checkmarks), so your screen should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/import.png" alt="Import sql" /></p>
<p>Now press the <em>Go</em> button at the bottom.</p>
<p>Your screen will now look something like below:</p>
<p><img src="images/after-import.png" alt="After importing tables" /></p>
<p>You can click on the database <code>movie-buff</code> on the left side and it should now look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/movie-buff-db.png" alt="movie-buff database" /></p>
<h2 id="studio">Studio</h2>
<p>Sarah has a very eclectic taste in movies, but her friends admire it. Over the years, they've borrowed a lot of her DVDs, and she's set up a database to keep track of who has watched what so that she can make better recommendations for them based on what they've seen so far.</p>
<p>There are four tables in the <code>movie-buff</code> database: <code>movies</code>, <code>directors</code>, <code>viewers</code>, and <code>viewings</code>. You can check out the structure of these tables by going to the &quot;Structure&quot; tab in your database and choosing a table. This will show you the column names and data types.</p>
<p><img src="images/structure.png" alt="Table structure" /></p>
<p>There is one table Sarah made that might not seem intuitive to have created: the <code>viewings</code> table. The structure of it is here:</p>
<p><img src="images/viewings.png" alt="Viewings table" /></p>
<p>The purpose of this table is to keep track of &quot;who watched what when&quot;. The <em>who</em> is the <code>viewer_id</code>, which is a foreign key that references the <code>viewer_id</code> in the <code>viewers</code> table. The <em>what</em> is the <code>movie_id</code> which is a foreign key that references the <code>movie_id</code> in the <code>movies</code> table. And the <em>when</em> is of course the <code>date_viewed</code> column with a <code>date</code> data type. Each viewing of a movie by one of Sarah's friends is captured as a unique record.</p>
<p>This kind of table is very common in relational database design. It has many virtues including that it clearly links the <code>movies</code> and <code>viewers</code> table together and it makes the database more maintainable. For instance, you might have chosen to make a <code>viewing</code> table where you actually list the movie title and the name of the viewer. But if you did that then anytime some of that information changes - say a friend gets married and changes last names - you would now have to update the name of the viewer in <em>both</em> the <code>viewers</code> table <em>and</em> the <code>viewings</code> table. With this design, any updates you make to either the <code>movies</code> or <code>viewers</code> table will be reflected automatically in the results from queries on the <code>viewings</code> table.</p>
<p>Review this lesson from <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/relational-queries-in-sql/a/splitting-data-into-related-tables">Khan Academy</a> for a more in-depth explanation of why we break tables up this way.</p>
<p>If you get stuck on any of the tasks below, you can review lessons in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql">Khan Academy</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp">w3schools</a> to get ideas and remind yourself of the proper syntax.</p>
<h3 id="your-task">Your Task:</h3>
<p>Sarah created these tables and inserted all the data into them, but she needs your help to run some queries. You can use the <em>SQL</em> tab in the <code>movie-buff</code> database to run queries. Just type your SQL statement(s) in the box and press the <em>Go</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="images/sql.png" alt="SQL tab" /></p>
<p>As an example, say Sarah wants to know the first and last names of any of her friends who borrowed one of her movies before 2010.</p>
<p>We know we'll want to use the <code>viewings</code> table, since that has the dates of when people have viewed her DVDs as well as their ids. And we know we want to use the <code>viewers</code> table since that has the first and last names of her friends. Since we want data from two tables, we know we'll likely need to use a <code>join</code>. We also know that the column in common between the two tables is the <code>viewer_id</code> column, so that will be what we join on. Our SQL statement will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT DISTINCT viewers.first, viewers.last
FROM viewers
JOIN viewings
ON viewers.viewer_id = viewings.viewer_id
WHERE viewings.date_viewed &lt; '2010-01-01'</code></pre>
<p>In phpMyAdmin:</p>
<p><img src="images/sample-query.png" alt="Sample query" /></p>
<p>And the results:</p>
<p><img src="images/sample-results.png" alt="Sample results" /></p>
<p>Here are some of the things Sarah needs your help with:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find out which countries the directors in her collection are from (and make sure your result set only lists each country only once).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are the French directors in her database?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the date of the first time someone viewed one of Sarah's movies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many movies in her collection were directed by people born in the USA?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the titles of the movies in her collection that were directed by Akira Kurosawa?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many times has the movie &quot;Talk to Me&quot; been viewed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When was the last time someone viewed one of her movies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the id of the last-viewed movie?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the title of the first movie she loaned to a friend for viewing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the first and last name of the person who viewed the last-viewed movie?</p>
</li>
</ol>
