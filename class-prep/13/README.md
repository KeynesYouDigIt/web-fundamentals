## Hashing

How can we ensure that our user's data--and passwords, in particular--is as safe as possible? As developers, we want to make sure we do as much as possible to prevent hackers from stealing and using passwords in the event of a data breach.

In this set of lessons, we'll learn how to securely store passwords using a technique called hashing.

As motivation for this lesson, [listen to Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG4wIOwbA90) talk about a mistake he made that exposed all of the user passwords on his site.
